I'm starting this out fairly simple and will add page objects a tiny bit 
later as time permits.

To run you will need
 1) a current version of ruby
 2) the following gems: Watir-webdriver, Cucumber, (and soon) Page-object
 3) Chrome (or change the browser setting)
 
The first example update.rb is pure quick and dirty coding, no framework, just a simple
ruby script that uses cucumber and will do the desired automation.
